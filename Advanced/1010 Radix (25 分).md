# 1010 Radix (25 åˆ†)

Given a pair of positive integers, for example, 6 and 110, can this equation 6 = 110 be true? The answer is yes, if 6 is a decimal number and 110 is a binary number.

Now for any pair of positive integers $N_1$ and $N_2$ your task is to find the radix of one number while that of the other is given.

## Input Specification:
Each input file contains one test case. Each case occupies a line which contains 4 positive integers:

`N1 N2 tag radix`

Here `N1` and `N2` each has no more than 10 digits. A digit is less than its radix and is chosen from the set { 0-9, `a`-`z` } where 0-9 represent the decimal numbers 0-9, and `a`-`z` represent the decimal numbers 10-35. The last number `radix` is the radix of `N1` if `tag` is 1, or of `N2` if `tag` is 2.

## Output Specification:
For each test case, print in one line the radix of the other number so that the equation `N1` = `N2` is true. If the equation is impossible, print `Impossible`. If the solution is not unique, output the smallest possible radix.

## Sample Input 1:
6 110 1 10

## Sample Output 1:
2

## Sample Input 2:
1 ab 1 2

## Sample Output 2:
Impossible
