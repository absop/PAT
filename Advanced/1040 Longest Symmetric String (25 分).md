# 1040 Longest Symmetric String (25 åˆ†)

Given a string, you are supposed to output the length of the longest symmetric sub-string. For example, given `Is PAT&TAP symmetric?`, the longest symmetric sub-string is `s PAT&TAP s`, hence you must output `11`.

## Input Specification:
Each input file contains one test case which gives a non-empty string of length no more than 1000.

## Output Specification:
For each test case, simply print the maximum length in a line.


##Sample Input:
Is PAT&TAP symmetric?

##Sample Output:
11
