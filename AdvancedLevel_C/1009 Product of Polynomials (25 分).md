# 1009 Product of Polynomials (25 分)

This time, you are supposed to find $A \times B$ where $A$ and $B$ are two polynomials.

## Input Specification:
Each input file contains one test case. Each case occupies 2 lines, and each line contains the information of a polynomial:

$K N_1 a_{N_1} N_​2 a_{N_​2} \cdots N_​K a_{​N_​K}$ ​​

where $K$ is the number of nonzero terms in the polynomial, $N_​i$ and $a_{N_i}(i = 1, 2, \cdots,K)$ are the exponents and coefficients, respectively. It is given that $1≤ K ≤10, 0 ≤ N_K < \cdots < N_2 < N_1 ≤ 1000$.

## Output Specification:
For each test case you should output the product of $A$ and $B$ in one line, with the same format as the input. Notice that there must be **NO** extra space at the end of each line. Please be accurate up to 1 decimal place.

## Sample Input:
```
2 1 2.4 0 3.2
2 2 1.5 1 0.5
```

## Sample Output:
```
3 3 3.6 2 6.0 1 1.6
```
