# 1020 Tree Traversals (25 分)

Suppose that all the keys in a binary tree are distinct positive integers. Given the postorder and inorder traversal sequences, you are supposed to output the level order traversal sequence of the corresponding binary tree.

## Input Specification:
Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line gives a positive integer $N (≤ 30)$, the total number of nodes in the binary tree. The second line gives the postorder sequence and the third line gives the inorder sequence. All the numbers in a line are separated by a space.

## Output Specification:
For each test case, print in one line the level order traversal sequence of the corresponding binary tree. All the numbers in a line must be separated by exactly one space, and there must be no extra space at the end of the line.

## Sample Input:
```
7
2 3 1 5 7 6 4
1 2 3 4 5 6 7
```

## Sample Output:
```
4 1 6 3 5 7 2
```
