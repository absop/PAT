# 1050 String Subtraction (20 åˆ†)

Given two strings $S_1$ and $S_2$, $S = S_1 - S_2$ is defined to be the remaining string after taking all the characters in $S_2$ from $S_1$. Your task is simply to calculate $S_1 - S_2$ for any given strings. However, it might not be that simple to do it **fast**.

## Input Specification:
Each input file contains one test case. Each case consists of two lines which gives $S_1$ and $S_2$, respectively. The string lengths of both strings are no more than $10^4$. It is guaranteed that all the characters are visible ASCII codes and white space, and a new line character signals the end of a string.

## Output Specification:
For each test case, print $S_1 - S_2$ in one line.

## Sample Input:
```
They are students.
aeiou
```

## Sample Output:
```
Thy r stdnts.
```
