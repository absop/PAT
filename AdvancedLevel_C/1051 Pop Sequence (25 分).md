# 1051 Pop Sequence (25 åˆ†)

Given a stack which can keep $M$ numbers at most. Push $N$ numbers in the order of $1, 2, 3, \cdots, N$ and pop randomly. You are supposed to tell if a given sequence of numbers is a possible pop sequence of the stack. For example, if $M$ is 5 and $N$ is 7, we can obtain $1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7$ from the stack, but not $3, 2, 1, 7, 5, 6, 4$.

## Input Specification:
Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line contains 3 numbers (all no more than 1000): $M$ (the maximum capacity of the stack), $N$ (the length of push sequence), and $K$ (the number of pop sequences to be checked). Then $K$ lines follow, each contains a pop sequence of $N$ numbers. All the numbers in a line are separated by a space.

## Output Specification:
For each pop sequence, print in one line "**YES**" if it is indeed a possible pop sequence of the stack, or "**NO**" if not.

## Sample Input:
```
5 7 5
1 2 3 4 5 6 7
3 2 1 7 5 6 4
7 6 5 4 3 2 1
5 6 4 3 7 2 1
1 7 6 5 4 3 2
```

## Sample Output:
```
YES
NO
NO
YES
NO
```
