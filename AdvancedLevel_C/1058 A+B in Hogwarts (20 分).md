# 1058 A+B in Hogwarts (20 åˆ†)

If you are a fan of Harry Potter, you would know the world of magic has its own currency system -- as Hagrid explained it to Harry, "Seventeen silver Sickles to a Galleon and twenty-nine Knuts to a Sickle, it's easy enough." Your job is to write a program to compute $A + B$ where $A$ and $B$ are given in the standard form of `Galleon.Sickle.Knut` (`Galleon` is an integer in $[0, 10^7]$, Sickle is an integer in [0, 17), and `Knut` is an integer in [0, 29)).

## Input Specification:
Each input file contains one test case which occupies a line with $A$ and $B$ in the standard form, separated by one space.

## Output Specification:
For each test case you should output the sum of $A$ and $B$ in one line, with the same format as the input.

## Sample Input:
```
3.2.1 10.16.27
```

## Sample Output:
```
14.1.28
```
