# 1060 Are They Equal (25 åˆ†)

If a machine can save only 3 significant digits, the float numbers 12300 and 12358.9 are considered equal since they are both saved as $0.123 \times 10^5$ with simple chopping. Now given the number of significant digits on a machine and two float numbers, you are supposed to tell if they are treated equal in that machine.

## Input Specification:
Each input file contains one test case which gives three numbers $N$, $A$ and $B$, where $N (< 100)$ is the number of significant digits, and $A$ and $B$ are the two float numbers to be compared. Each float number is non-negative, no greater than $10^100$, and that its total digit number is less than $100$.

## Output Specification:
For each test case, print in a line `YES` if the two numbers are treated equal, and then the number in the standard form `0.d[1]...d[N]*10^k` (`d[1]`>0 unless the number is 0); or `NO` if they are not treated equal, and then the two numbers in their standard form. All the terms must be separated by a space, with no extra space at the end of a line.

Note: Simple chopping is assumed without rounding.

## Sample Input 1:
```
3 12300 12358.9
```

## Sample Output 1:
```
YES 0.123*10^5
```

## Sample Input 2:
```
3 120 128
```

## Sample Output 2:
```
NO 0.120*10^3 0.128*10^3
```
